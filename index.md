#### Biography

I am a Ph.D. student at [Computer Science Department](http://cs.gc.cuny.edu/), [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/), [City University of New York](http://www.cuny.edu/index.html) (CUNY). [[Curriculum Vitae](cv.pdf)]

Now I work with [Prof. Liang Huang](http://acl.cs.qc.edu/~lhuang/) in [Algorithms for Computational Linguistics](http://acl.cs.qc.edu/) (ACL) Group. My research is focused on algorithms and theory in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in structured prediction problems including **parsing** and **machine translation**. I am also very interested in Machine Learning like **online learning** and **large margin methods**.

I have been very fortunate to spend two summers working on machine translation at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/) with [Hany Hassan](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/hanyh/) and [Michael Auli](http://michaelauli.github.io/) (in 2014), and at [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) with [Abe Ittycheriah](#) and [Haitao Mi](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-hmi) (in 2013). 

Prior to CUNY, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree from [Computer Science Department](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC) in 2010.

#### Codes for Fun

* [Dependency Tree Viewer](deptreeviewer): a tool to visualize (projective) dependency trees with JavaScript. Now it only supports nested parentheses format and CONLL-X format. (For syntax tree there is [a great viewer](http://mshang.ca/syntree/) from [Miles Shang](http://mshang.ca/).)

* [EverTeX](http://github.com/kaayy/everTex): I am not a heavy Evernote user, but its lack of LaTeX-style formula support is really annoying. So I wrote this Firefox greasemonkey plugin to help LaTeX formula input/display in Evernote website.
