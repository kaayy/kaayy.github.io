#### Biography

I recently joined Google as a research scientist. 

I received my Ph.D. degree from [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/), [Oregon State University](http://www.oregonstate.edu).

My research is focused on algorithms and theory in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in structured prediction problems including **syntactic/semantic parsing**, **machine translation**, and **textual entailment**. I am also very interested in Machine Learning like **online learning** and **deep learning**. My advisor is [Prof. Liang Huang](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/).

Prior to Oregon State University, I started my Ph.D. study at [Computer Science Department](http://cs.gc.cuny.edu/), [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/), [City University of New York](http://www.cuny.edu/index.html) (CUNY). I received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree from [Computer Science Department](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC) in 2010.

#### Softwares

I am cleaning up and releasing my old codes for some of the papers listed above. Hopefully these can help people doing related researches. I usually write in Python, sometimes in C/C++ for efficiency reasons. My experience with C# at Microsoft is fascinating. (LINQ and parallelization are my favorites.) I am looking forword to seeing it become more popular. For deep learning I mostly write in Lua with Torch.

* [Joint Syntaco-Discourse Parser and Treebank](https://github.com/kaayy/josydipa)

* [Textual Entailment with Structured Attentions and Composition](https://github.com/kaayy/structured-attention)

* [Type-driven Incremental Semantic Parser](https://github.com/kaayy/TISP)

* Optimal Incremental Dependency Parser with Best-First Dynamic Programming: to be ready soon.

<br/>

#### Codes for Fun

* [Dependency Tree Viewer](deptreeviewer): a tool to visualize (unlabeled) dependency trees with JavaScript. It supports nested brackets format, CONLL-X format, and Stanford format. (For syntax tree there is [a great viewer](http://mshang.ca/syntree/) from [Miles Shang](http://mshang.ca/).)

* [EverTeX](http://github.com/kaayy/everTex): I am not a heavy Evernote user, but its lack of LaTeX-style formula support is really annoying. So I wrote this Firefox greasemonkey plugin to help LaTeX formula input/display in Evernote website.
