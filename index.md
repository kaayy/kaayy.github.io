#### Biography

I am a Ph.D. student at [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/), [Oregon State University](http://www.oregonstate.edu). [[Curriculum Vitae](cv.pdf)]

Now I work with [Prof. Liang Huang](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/) in [Algorithms for Computational Linguistics](#) (ACL) Group. My research is focused on algorithms and theory in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in structured prediction problems including **parsing** and **machine translation**. I am also very interested in Machine Learning like **online learning** and **large margin methods**.

I have been very fortunate to work with [Hao Zhang](http://research.google.com/pubs/HaoZhang.html) at [Google Research](https://research.google.com/) on data mining from structured data in the summer of 2015, with [Hany Hassan](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/hanyh/) and [Michael Auli](http://michaelauli.github.io/) at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/) in the summer of 2014, and with [Abe Ittycheriah](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/abe-ittycheriah/1/142/466) and [Haitao Mi](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-hmi) at [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) in the summer of 2013 on machine translation.

Prior to Oregon State University, I started my Ph.D. study at [Computer Science Department](http://cs.gc.cuny.edu/), [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/), [City University of New York](http://www.cuny.edu/index.html) (CUNY). I received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree from [Computer Science Department](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC) in 2010.

#### Codes for Fun

* [Dependency Tree Viewer](deptreeviewer): a tool to visualize (projective) dependency trees with JavaScript. Now it only supports nested parentheses format and CONLL-X format. (For syntax tree there is [a great viewer](http://mshang.ca/syntree/) from [Miles Shang](http://mshang.ca/).)

* [EverTeX](http://github.com/kaayy/everTex): I am not a heavy Evernote user, but its lack of LaTeX-style formula support is really annoying. So I wrote this Firefox greasemonkey plugin to help LaTeX formula input/display in Evernote website.
